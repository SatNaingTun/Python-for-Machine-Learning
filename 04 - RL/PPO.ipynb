    "# Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) where machines learn by experimenting, somewhat like students learning through trial and error. They aim to make the best decisions to maximize rewards in various scenarios. RL is used in applications like robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proximal Policy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the priminent algorithms are **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, released by OpenAI in 2017, cited more than 10k times.  It serves as a reliable guide for computers to learn effectively. Instead of making big changes all at once, PPO encourages gradual and more stable improvements, which is crucial for the learning process. PPO finds application in various real-world situations, and we'll explore its principles and significance in more detail.\n",

    "## Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some quick terminologies before we start:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents** - the primary entity interacting with the environment\n",
    "- **Environment** - the primary thing that the agents interact with\n",
    "- **Policy ($\\pi$)**: a policy defines the probability of an action given a state.  The policy guides the agent in selecting actions that maximize its expected cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "- **States / observation** ($s_t$) - a snapshot of the environment at timestep $t$\n",
    "- **Action** ($a_t$) - the possible actions that the agents can perform to the environment at timestep $t$\n",
    "- **Rewards / returns** ($r_t$) - the rewards received each time the agents perform an action at timestep $t$ given state $s$\n",
    "  \n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "## Advanced one...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Episode** - a single run of the agent interacting with the environment, starting from an initial state ntil a terminal state is reached.\n",
    "- **Rollout** - another name for data collection, so we can train our RL agents on.\n",
    "- **Discounted sum of rewards ($G_t$)** - the amount of immediate rewards and expected future discounted rewards \n",
    "- **Discount Factor ($\\gamma$)**: A parameter that determines the importance of future rewards. A value of 0 indicates that only immediate rewards matter, while a value of 1 considers all future rewards equally.\n",
    "- **Value function** ($V(s)$) - a function that estimates the expected discounted sum of rewards if the agent start at state $s$ until the terminal state, following its current policy\n",
    "- **Exploration / Exploitation** - The trade-off between trying new actions to learn more about the environment (exploration) and exploiting known actions to maximize immediate rewards (exploitation) -->\n",

    "## 1. Vanilla Policy Gradient Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla policy gradient methods have an objective function to maximize as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E} (\\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t) \\hat{A}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}$ stands for expected value but is simply short hand for empirical average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Actor networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side $\\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)$ returns the log probability of actions given the current state.  Common way to get is through deep neural network.  This network is commonly called the **actor network**.   It takes in states and output the probability distributions of all actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to train this **actor network** is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform rollout and collect a sequences of states, actions, and rewards\n",
    "2. Once you finish many episodes, \n",
    "   1. Go back to each time step, compute $G_t$ for each timestep where\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$G_t = \\gamma^0 R_{t} + \\gamma^1 R_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \\ldots + \\gamma^{T-t} R_T = \\sum_{k=t}^{T} \\gamma^{k-t} \\cdot R_{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximize $\\mathbb{E} (\\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t) G_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Advantage function\n",
    "\n",
    "The right side of the equation - the Advantage $\\hat{A}_t$ function is simply calculating the *advantage* of taking a certain action, compared to the average performance.  If $\\hat{A}$ is positive, it means the action taken is generally better than average, while negative means vice versa.  If it is zero, it means that the action taken is no better than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{A}_t = G_t - V(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V(s)$ is the **state value function** or the **value function** that calculates the average discounted sum of rewards whenever the agent stay in this state until the end.  It is commonly calculated using the **critic network** (or sometimes the value network).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Critic network\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a neural network that takes in states $(s)$ and output its corresponding value $(V(s))$.  The way to train this network is simply:\n",

    "### In summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it's basically maximizing the probability of actions, multiplied by its relative rewards compared to average.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Trust Region Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanilla policy gradient methods often suffer from too large policy updates, causing it fail to find the solution due to the large solution space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Trust Region Policy Gradient (TRPO)** modifies the objective function to maximize to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}(\\frac{\\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\\log \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)} \\hat{A}_t) - \\beta \\text{KL}(\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}( \\cdot | s_t), \\pi_{\\theta}( \\cdot | s_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term calculates the **ratio** instead of the probability, which would help the model to find meaningful updates.  Larger difference, the better.  However, too large updates can cause a lot of problem, thus we constrain the difference between old policy and new policy using KL divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For those who don't know what is KL divergence, you can easily search up the equation, but it is a very simple equation of $P \\log \\frac{P}{Q}$ which simply measures how different is two distributions $P$ and $Q$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we want *high* entropy, thus we put minus in front for a minimization problem.  $\\lambda$ is simply a coefficient to control this entropy bonus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how entropy helps exploration, a simple example of **entropy** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have three actions, A1, A2, and A3. The probabilities to each action as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A1: $P(A1) = 0.9$\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A2: $P(A2) = 0.05$\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A3: $P(A3) = 0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy of this policy can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "S &= -\\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(A_i) \\ln(P(A_i)) \\\\\n",
    "S &= -(0.9 \\ln(0.9) + 0.05 \\ln(0.05) + 0.05 \\ln(0.05)) \\\\\n",
    "S &\\approx 0.394\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's change the probabilities to \n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A1: $P(A1) = 0.4$\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A2: $P(A2) = 0.3$\n",
    "- Probability of selecting A3: $P(A3) = 0.3$\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy $S$ will be 1.08.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus higher entropy encourages the model to explore more actions, instead of just making one action very prominent.  However, it is important to note that we should balance exploration and exploitation by putting a coefficient in front of this entropy to control how much we want to explore.\n",
